                      John Legend on His A Cappella Past, Running for Office, and Black Lives Matter
                      He's been killing it on the keys since he was a kid, but, as Mickey Rapkin learns, John Legend's prowess goes beyond the piano—just ask his groupies. (And we're not   just talking about his wife, Chrissy Teigen.)
                      <p> Legend may not be his real name, but damn if he isn't living up to the moniker. John Legend (born John Rogers Stephens) is a 10-time Grammy winner who added a Best Original Song Oscar to his fireplace mantel last year for "Glory," the rousing anthem he cowrote with Common for 2014's Selma. Legend's wife—TV host, model, and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen—meanwhile won the Internet equivalent of an Oscar for her "cry face," which became an instant-classic meme. The two married in 2013 in Lake Como, Italy, and welcomed a baby girl, Luna, earlier this year. Theirs is a modern love story chronicled on Instagram: After they announced they were pregnant, no less than Kim and Kanye took them shopping for the essentials. (Actually, Kanye fell asleep in a chair. Kim hashtagged the photo: #TheRealLifeOfPablo.)
                      </p>
                       <p>It's been a wild ride from the beginning. Legend, 37, grew up in Springfield, Ohio—the son of a factory worker and a part-time seamstress—and studied English at the University of Pennsylvania, where he sang in an a cappella group on campus while earning extra cash playing piano part time in a Scranton church. He worked in management consulting briefly after graduation, but happily for him and us, he couldn't stay away from music. His biggest hit, "All of Me," a wedding anthem written for Teigen, is one of the top-selling singles of all time, and his next album is due out this month. He also puts his musicianship to work onscreen as a jazz guitarist in the absurdly romantic Oscar hopeful La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.</p>

                        <p>Mickey Rapkin: You've got a track on the new album called "Penthouse Floor," about your fight to stay true to your roots in the face of extreme fame.

                            John Legend: Metaphorically, I live on the penthouse floor now. I have a big house in Beverly Hills, and I've come a long way from my humble upbringing in Ohio. I'm thinking about what it was like to look up to that. In a very subtle way, the song is about my understanding of the history of housing segregation and income inequality.</p>

                        <p>THE SUBTEXT IS BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS AND UPRISINGS IN PLACES LIKE FERGUSON AND BALTIMORE, AND HOW THE NEWS CAMERAS ONLY COME TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHEN CONFLICT IS HAPPENING.
                        And here I thought it was about having sex in a suite.</p>

                        <p>[Laughs] The song sounds so sexy—and that was intentional—but the subtext is less sexy. It's about "movin' on up to the East Side," like George Jefferson, but that first line is, "All this trouble in this here town, all this shit going down…. Streets with TV crews on them, and look, we're on the news, but they didn't notice before this." The subtext is Black Lives Matter protesters and uprisings in places like Ferguson and Baltimore, and how the news cameras only come to those communities when conflict is happening.

                        You're active in politics, notably railing against the issues with mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline in the United States. Would you ever run for office?</p>
                        <p>
                        No.

                        Why not?

                        I respect people who are willing to deal with everything that comes with being a politician, but I'm not willing to deal with half the country rooting for you to fail. I'm a singer; I deal with enough. But at least half the country's not trying to destroy me.

                        I RESPECT PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO DEAL WITH EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH BEING A POLITICIAN, BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO DEAL WITH HALF THE COUNTRY ROOTING FOR YOU TO FAIL.
                        What's left to uncover? Your wife already Instagrammed a photo of your butt.</p>

                        <p>I regretted that butt photo. At the time, we were both drunk and it was all fun and games. But the next morning I wasn't too proud of it.</p>


                        <p>Lauryn Hill
                        GETTY
                        You played on Lauryn Hill's track "Everything Is Everything" while you were still in college. Did you tell Lauryn that you were in an a cappella group?

                        No, I did not. [Laughs] Believe it or not, for someone like me who was really shy, it was a way of being more social. Because once people saw me sing, it kind of broke the ice. I didn't have to approach people as much. They would come up to me and say, "Oh, that was a great job, blah blah blah." I became pretty well-known on campus.

                        Are we talking about a cappella groupies?

                        I don't know if you would call them groupies, but there were fans.

                        When you went to bed with a woman—and your last name is Legend—was there some pressure to deliver?

                        I've never thought of it that way.</p>

                        <p>Really?

                        I've felt like it put pressure on me as an artist. If you're going to call yourself "Legend," you'd better make some good-ass music. But I've never felt like it was directly referencing my sexual prowess—or lack thereof.

                        "All of Me" is very sentimental. Does Chrissy expect you to be like that all the time? Or is it okay to just, like, watch Bravo one night?

                        You know, Chrissy's kind of funny and cynical. I don't think she ever expected me to be super-romantic and super-sappy all the time. But one of her favorites was when I hired ballet dancers to come and dance for us for our anniversary.</p>

                        <p>Wait, you had a ballet company come to your house?

                        No, to this hotel we were staying at. It was a private performance before dinner. We were in western Massachusetts, in the Berkshires. I can't remember exactly which company it was. It took me a while to find somebody who would drive up from New York. Chrissy loves the ballet. That's her secret dream—to be a ballet dancer.


                        GETTYAMANDA EDWARDS
                        You were very open about your and Chrissy's struggle to get pregnant. What did you learn about each other during that time?

                        I think it makes you more of a team—even more than you were before—because when you have a goal together and it's not guaranteed and you have ups and downs, it just brings you closer. You have each other's back even more.
