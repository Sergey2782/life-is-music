                  <p>
                    On the back of his debut album Telluric hitting no. 1 in Australia last week, Indie Shuffle spent time on the phone chatting with Australian singer-songwriter Matt Corby. Matt had just finished a sound check for an upcoming show that night in Germany and was still digesting the recent news of his quick ascent to a number 1 debut album.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    In this interview Matt talks openly about what Telluric means, why genres don’t mean anything anymore, his thoughts on the music industry in general and about his plans to start making a second album.

                    Congrats on the news this week Matt, Telluric hit #1 on the ARIA charts!

                    It’s pretty special and pretty unexpected. When I made this album I was really hoping it wasn’t going to be completely poo pooed by Australians. Because at the time you don’t know if you’re crazy or if you’re making something that will gel with people. That all sounds silly now it’s hit no. 1, but I think every artist has an insecurity and tendency to think like that.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                    It’s probably better than I’m not in Australia right now experiencing it there. I like that it’s a little more downplayed and I’m happy for a bit of separation right now. The whole thing was so low key. The band and I got told, “Hey it's number 1!" and we were like like, "Oh nice!” Now let's go do our sound check.
                    </p>
                    Your Australian fans in particular have known and loved your work for many years now. I’m wondering why it took such a long time to make a full length album? What have you spent the last couple of years doing?
                    <p>
                    I spent the last couple of years living like a bit of a hermit with a full instrument set up at home with drums, bass, a piano, guitars and whatever else I could find to make music. I was even playing the sax there for a while and it took me a while to get that one right!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I was trying to work out how to make full moving compositions on my own so I could be a bit more self-sufficient as an artist. I wanted to know the ins and outs of how to groove and how to swing groove. I wanted to know how to put harmonies and melodies over the top of all of that and explore all of the various ways that was possible.

                    By being able to play all the instruments myself was my way of recording a convincing album where the majority of its parts came directly from me. That took me a long to figure out. And so at the start of last year I was like, “Wow, I think I’m ready. Let’s go!” We wrote maybe 25 songs and about half of that ended up being Telluric.


                    Speaking of which, tell us what “telluric” means and represents? How does it fit into the context of the album?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The title Telluric came last. I was sitting around a little fireplace at home and my friend told me this word and I said, “Oh hey, that’s beautiful. What does it mean?” She described it as terrestrial, of the Earth, of something that stems from Earth’s intelligence.

                    The record is predominantly about trying to figure out what it means to be a human. I think this a big part of it—about understanding that there’s no divide between you and everything else that’s going on around you. It’s about what we experience every day and finding ways to figure out where we fit in this world. That's definitely a positive thing.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                    How would you describe the sound on this album?

                    We’ve been asked this a few times. When you’re out on tour and you jump on a bus with a bunch of people and they say, “Oh you guys look like you’re in a band, what kind of music do you play?” And we all say, “Ummm... ummm? I don’t know!”

                    Everyone in the band has a slightly different answer and normally we'll will list off three or four genres saying it’s kind of a bit jazzy, there’s a slight psychedelic element to it and it’s more like a new version of soul music. It’s this hilarious dance that we do around what genres we fit into.

                    But I don’t really know what it is. I’ve spent my whole life digesting so many different types of music that I wanted to incorporate as much of all of them as possible inside this record. I’m trying not to fit into a genre. You don’t have to do that anymore.


                    You’ve been involved with the music industry from such a young age Matt. You were making music and become a popular music figure in Australia as a teenager. If you could change something about the music industry, what might it be?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                    Shit, man. I mean we could sit down for two days and just talk about that.

                    It’s a really tricky question for me to answer. What I don’t like is when artists put out a bunch of music that all sounds the same so people can recognize and get used to a pattern. I see this kind of music a lot and artists end up getting exploited for money and profit. That kind of thing really doesn’t sit well with me.

                    That approach to making music doesn’t help people connect with music in new ways, because let’s face it, music is capable of producing deep thought and a wide range of different emotions. Music is a way to make you think about yourself and the world differently. You want it to make you stop and put you in a moment of harmony and rhythm. It gets back to that genre thing, music should be about expanding one’s mind rather than putting everything into a box.


                    Shifting gears here Matt. What do you do when you’re not being a musician? Do you have a hobby or a place in the world that rejuvenates you as an artist?

                    I do. It’s fairly specific. It’s more a place I get to when I feel like I don’t need to play for awhile. But then again, I’m probably a little obsessive in that I am always making music! I enjoy my alone time and I’ll have all my instruments and my recording stuff with me. That’s when I just want to get on the kit and play beats or kick back and chill in the ocean. Whenever I get to do things like that, I just feel like a new human being again.

                    You’re on a long tour Matt. You’ve done North America, Europe currently and then concert dates in Australia. Anything fun planned for after it wraps and perhaps for the second half of 2016?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I haven’t really thought about that. That all seems pretty far away. My plan was to go back to Australia, to be there for a little while and definitely somewhere close to a beach. And who knows, maybe I'll start making the next record? I’m kind of excited to make another album because I feel like there was a lot of stuff on this one that I could have done better!

                    You’re super modest Matt! There’s plenty of people who already think it’s great. Congrats again on your number 1 Australian album and thanks for speaking today with Indie Shuffle.
